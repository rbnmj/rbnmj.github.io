# Headless usage guide

âš  This feature is experimental.

The tool automatically generates an Atom feed at `https://<owner>.github.io>/<repo>/feed.atom`. You can use any other feed reader to consume the content.

- You can set a custom title to the feed by changing `siteTitle` in the config. See [full reference](./osmosfeed-yaml-reference.md).
